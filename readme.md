# ðŸš€ Getting Started with React

## âœ… Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** (optional) as your package manager

## ðŸ“¦ Create a New React App (with Create React App)

Use `create-react-app` to quickly set up a standard React project:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will run the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## âš¡ Create a New React App (with Vite â€” faster & lightweight)

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) is a modern alternative to CRA that offers faster startup and build times.

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- 
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will run your app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.
